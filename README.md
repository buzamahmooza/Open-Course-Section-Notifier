# Open-Course-Section-Notifier
Program/script that notifies you when a KFUPM course section is open.


#How it works:
- Fetches course data and status from http://registrar.kfupm.edu.sa/CourseOffering using JavaScript ```xmlhttprequest```.
- If the specified section is open, the user is then notified.
